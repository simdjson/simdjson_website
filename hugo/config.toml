* **Fast:** Over 2.5x faster than other production-grade JSON parsers.
* **Easy:** First-class, easy-to-use API.
* **Strict:** Full JSON and UTF-8 validation, lossless parsing. Performance with no compromises.
* **Automatic:** Selects a CPU-tailored parser at runtime. No configuration needed.
* **Reliable:** From memory allocation to error handling, simdjson's design avoids surprises.

This library is part of the [Awesome Modern C++](https://awesomecpp.com) list and of major linux distributions like [Ubuntu](https://packages.ubuntu.com/source/eoan/simdjson) and [Debian](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/source/simdjson).
 """

contentTwoBody = """
* [**Multithreaded processing**](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson/blob/master/doc/basics.md#newline-delimited-json-ndjson-and-json-lines)  of gigantic Newline-Delimited JSON (ndjson) and related formats
* [**JSON Pointer**](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson/blob/master/doc/basics.md#json-pointer) support so that you can query your document at high speed
* [**Support both conventional error handling (exceptions) as well as an error-code approach**](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson/blob/master/doc/basics.md#error-handling): you can compile your C++ code with or without exception support.
* [**Runtime dispatch**](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson/blob/master/doc/implementation-selection.methods): the library automatically detects the features supported by the processor. The library runs on all 64-bit systems, but it automagically benefits from advanced processors.
